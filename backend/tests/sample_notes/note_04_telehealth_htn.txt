TRANSCRIPT (verbatim-style)
Clinician: What brings you in today?
Patient: Mostly my blood pressure meds. I ran out like… a week ago.
Clinician: Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
Patient: No chest pain. Breathing's fine. I'm just getting headaches when my pressure's high.
Clinician: Any vision changes, weakness, trouble speaking?
Patient: No, none of that.
Clinician: What meds were you taking?
Patient: Lisinopril 20, and that water pill—hydro… hydrochloro-something.
Clinician: Hydrochlorothiazide?
Patient: Yeah, that. I take it when I remember. Probably missed a bunch.
Clinician: Any swelling in your legs?
Patient: Not really. Maybe a little at the end of the day but nothing crazy.
Clinician: Any kidney problems?
Patient: Not that I know of. Last labs were "normal" per my doctor.
Clinician: Any allergies?
Patient: Penicillin makes me break out in a rash. No breathing problems though.
