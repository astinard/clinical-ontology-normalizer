AUTHOR: Taylor Example, MD (Radiology)

PATIENT: TEST, NOVEMBER
MRN: TEST20016
DOB: 1965-12-01
AGE/SEX: 60-year-old male

EXAM: CT Chest with IV Contrast (CT Angiography Protocol)

CLINICAL INDICATION: 60-year-old male with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer. Rule out pulmonary embolism.

COMPARISON: CXR from 2026-01-29.

TECHNIQUE: Helical CT of the chest was performed following administration of 75 mL Omnipaque 350 IV contrast with pulmonary embolism protocol timing. Coronal and sagittal reformats were generated.

FINDINGS:

PULMONARY ARTERIES:
- Main pulmonary artery: Normal caliber.
- Right pulmonary artery: Filling defect in the segmental artery to the right lower lobe posterior basal segment, consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
- Left pulmonary artery: No filling defect. Branches opacify normally.
- No saddle embolus.
- No right heart strain (RV:LV ratio < 1.0).

LUNGS:
- Right lower lobe: Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the posterior basal segment, likely representing pulmonary infarct. No cavitation.
- Left lung: Clear. No masses or nodules.
- No pneumothorax.
- No significant atelectasis.

AIRWAYS:
- Trachea and main bronchi: Patent.
- No endobronchial lesion.

PLEURA:
- Small right pleural effusion, likely reactive.
- No left pleural effusion.
- No pneumothorax.

MEDIASTINUM:
- Heart size: Normal.
- No pericardial effusion.
- Thoracic aorta: Normal caliber, no dissection.
- Mediastinal lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy.

CHEST WALL:
- No suspicious osseous lesions.
- Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.

LIMITED UPPER ABDOMEN:
- Liver, spleen, adrenals: Unremarkable on limited views.

IMPRESSION:
1. ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe posterior basal segment.
2. RIGHT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY INFARCT: Peripheral wedge-shaped consolidation consistent with pulmonary infarction.
3. SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Likely reactive.
4. No evidence of right heart strain by CT criteria.

CRITICAL FINDING: Acute pulmonary embolism. Findings communicated to Dr. Smith (ED physician) by phone at 08:35 on 2026-01-30.
