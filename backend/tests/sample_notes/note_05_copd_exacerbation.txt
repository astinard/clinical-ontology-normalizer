VITAL SIGNS (ED triage)
14:15  BP 148/88  HR 102  RR 26  Temp 37.4 C  SpO2 86% on 2L NC (home O2)
After 4L NC: SpO2 91%

PHYSICAL EXAM
General: Moderate respiratory distress, tripoding, speaking in short phrases.
HEENT: No oropharyngeal erythema.
Neck: No JVD.
Cardiac: Regular rate, tachycardic, no murmurs.
Lungs: Diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally, prolonged expiratory phase, decreased breath sounds at bases. No crackles.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender.
Extremities: No edema. No calf tenderness.

ED COURSE
Differential includes acute COPD exacerbation (likely infectious trigger), pneumonia, heart failure exacerbation, PE (low suspicion).

Given purulent sputum, worsening dyspnea, and mild leukocytosis, clinical picture consistent with acute exacerbation of COPD likely with infectious trigger.

CXR shows hyperinflation but no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion.

TREATMENTS IN ED
- Oxygen increased to 4L NC (target SpO2 88-92%)
- Albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer x3
- Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x1
- Azithromycin 500 mg PO x1

RESULTS
LABS (14:40)
- WBC 12.4 K/uL (elevated)
- Hgb 14.2 g/dL
- Plt 245 K/uL
- BMP within normal limits
- Procalcitonin 0.18 ng/mL (low)
- BNP 89 pg/mL (normal)

ABG (on 4L NC):
- pH 7.36
- pCO2 52 mmHg (elevated)
- pO2 62 mmHg
- HCO3 28 mmol/L

CXR: Hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragms. No focal consolidation. No effusion.

ASSESSMENT
1) Acute exacerbation of COPD, likely infectious etiology.
2) Hypoxic respiratory failure, chronic.
3) Tobacco use disorder, current.

PLAN
- Admit to medicine for continued bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics.
- Continue oxygen therapy; target SpO2 88-92%.
- Smoking cessation counseling.
- Pulmonology follow-up after discharge.

DISPOSITION
Admit: Medicine/Telemetry.
Condition: Stable.
